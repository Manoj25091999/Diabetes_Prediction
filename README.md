# Diabetes_Prediction
Diabetes prediction using Machine Learning (Logistic Regression)

While building this model, our objective is to predict whether the patient has diabetes or not based on various features like Glucose level, Insulin, Age, BMI. We will perform all the steps from Data gathering to Model deployment. During Model evaluation, I compared various machine learning algorithms on the basis of accuracy_score metric and find the best one, what find out that other algorithms are not good in accuracy (around 72-74%) in comparison to Logistic Regression (around 76.62%) so in this module I have predicted whether the person has diabetes or not, on "Pima Indian Diabetes Dataset" using Logistic Regression and then tuned it to get an accuracy around 81.16%.
